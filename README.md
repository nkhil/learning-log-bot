# Learning log bot

I recently came across a blog post about [Why everyone will benefit from a learning log](https://boyney123.medium.com/why-you-should-keep-a-development-log-9dfcc853e4e1). 

My problem is that I start learning logs, but it's hard to consistently update it. I thought I'd try and create a bot that I could message, or that could remind me if I hadn't updated my learning log for a few days.
